Strategy: Work Order Downtime Integration
Perfect! I've analyzed your system and found that the database schema already supports exactly what you need - estimatedDowntimeHours and actualDowntimeHours fields exist in work orders, but they're not being used in the UI or connected to vessel status calculations.

Current State Analysis
✅ What's Already Working:

Database schema has estimatedDowntimeHours and actualDowntimeHours fields
Work order management system with create/edit forms
Vessel management with onlineStatus field
Equipment-vessel relationships via equipmentId
❌ The Gap:

Downtime fields are not shown in work order forms
Vessel status only uses heartbeat (5-minute rule)
No connection between work order downtime and vessel availability
Analytics don't include downtime calculations
Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Work Order Form Enhancement
Add downtime fields to create/edit work order forms
Update validation schemas to include downtime validation
Display downtime in work order tables and details
Phase 2: Vessel Status Integration
Create vessel status calculator - Check active work orders with downtime
Update vessel status logic - Combine heartbeat status with work order downtime
Status rules: If vessel has active work orders with estimatedDowntimeHours > 0, mark as "offline"
Phase 3: Analytics Integration
Add downtime metrics to analytics dashboards
Calculate availability - (Total time - Downtime) / Total time
Historical tracking - Show downtime trends over time
Phase 4: Real-time Updates
Auto-update vessel status when work orders are created/updated/completed
Recalculate availability when downtime changes
Visual indicators for maintenance-related offline status
Implementation Plan
I'll implement this by:

Updating work order forms to include estimated downtime input fields
Creating vessel status service that considers both heartbeat and work order status
Enhancing vessel management to show calculated availability status
Adding downtime analytics to show vessel availability metrics
Connecting everything so work order downtime automatically affects vessel status
This will give you real-time vessel availability tracking based on actual maintenance activities, not just device connectivity.

Ready to proceed? This will transform your work orders from simple task tracking into a comprehensive downtime management system that directly impacts vessel operational status.
