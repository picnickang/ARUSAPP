Inventory Management & Work Orders – Full Integration



Enhancements to Inventory Management:

Catalogue + Stock Linking

Link Parts Catalogue with Stock Levels so data always aligns.

Ensure Unit Cost in catalogue = Per Unit Value in stock.

Allow editing of:

Quantity on hand

Quantity in reserve

Sorting and searching:

By part number

By part name

Ensure all values stay synchronized between catalogue and stock.

Suppliers & Substitutions

Suppliers tab must be functional.

Allow defining substitution rules for each part.

Maintain supplier references when calculating lead times, costs, and availability.

Risk Analysis & Optimization

Inventory risk module should:

Highlight low stock, long lead-time parts, and substitution risks.

Generate optimization strategies for stocking and procurement.

Factor supplier lead times and substitution rules into optimization.



Integration with Work Orders:

Parts & Costs

Allow adding parts from catalogue to work orders.

Auto-calculate costs based on parts used.

Labor Inputs

Input fields for:

Estimated hours of repair

Estimated cost per hour

Estimated downtime

ROI & Analytics

Link repair cost + downtime cost into ROI analytics.

Display financial and operational impacts of each work order.

Scheduling

Work orders can be linked directly into new schedules.

Downtime and crew availability should be factored into scheduling optimization.





Fleet Optimization – Fix & Expand



Current Issues:

Solver is not running properly (gets stuck).

RUL data is unreliable.

Trend generation missing.

Fleet control panel buttons non-functional.



Required Fixes & Enhancements:

Optimization Solver

Repair or replace scheduling/optimization solver.

Ensure it runs reliably and produces actionable outputs.

RUL Integration

Integrate Remaining Useful Life predictions from PdM models.

Show confidence intervals and highlight critical components.

Trend Generation

Generate fleet-wide and per-vessel trends (fuel, downtime, maintenance cost).

Include anomaly detection visualizations.

Fleet Controls

Fix broken UI buttons.

Ensure controls actually trigger backend processes (optimization, reporting, etc).

Summary Request for Replit:

Please implement all of the above to make the Inventory Management, Work Orders, and Fleet Optimization modules fully functional, reliable, and tightly integrated. Ensure data consistency, financial impact tracking, and predictive optimization. The result should rival or exceed leading marine maintenance platforms.
