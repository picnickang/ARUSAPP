Strategy: Equipment Registry Vessel Integration
I've analyzed your current equipment registry and identified the issue: vessel names are manually typed in text fields instead of being selected from your vessel management system. This leads to inconsistencies and duplicate/misspelled vessel names.

Current State Analysis
✅ What's Working:

Vessel management system with proper vessel records
Equipment fetches vessels for assignment functionality
Dual support for vesselId (FK) and vesselName (legacy text)
❌ The Problem:

Equipment creation/edit forms use free-text input for vessel names
No validation against existing vessel records
Leads to data inconsistency and typos
Creates "legacy" vessel name entries that aren't linked to vessel records
Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Update Equipment Forms (Frontend)
Replace text input with dropdown - Change vesselName field to vesselId selection
Enhance form validation - Use vessel records from vessel management
Update form logic - Pre-select vessels in edit mode, handle vessel data consistently
Phase 2: Backend Integration
Update API endpoints - Accept vesselId and auto-populate vesselName
Maintain compatibility - Support both old and new data structures
Enhance data integrity - Ensure vessel linkage is properly maintained
Phase 3: UI/UX Improvements
Simplify workflow - Remove redundant vessel assignment dialogs
Visual consistency - Show vessel status clearly in equipment list
Legacy data handling - Clear indicators for unlinked vessel names
Implementation Plan
I'll implement this by:

Updating equipment forms to use vessel dropdowns instead of text inputs
Modifying form schemas to work with vesselId while maintaining vesselName for compatibility
Enhancing the edit flow to properly pre-select vessels from existing records
Updating backend endpoints to handle vessel association during equipment creation/update
This will ensure data consistency, better user experience, and integration between your vessel management and equipment registry systems.
