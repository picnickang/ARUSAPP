# Overview

ARUS (Marine Predictive Maintenance & Scheduling) is a full-stack web application designed for monitoring marine equipment health, processing telemetry data, and performing predictive maintenance. Its core purpose is to enhance operational efficiency, reduce downtime through advanced predictive analytics, and ensure regulatory compliance for marine fleets. Key capabilities include real-time device monitoring, equipment health analytics, intelligent predictive maintenance scheduling, and advanced inventory management. The project aims to deliver a comprehensive, intelligent platform leveraging advanced predictive analytics and compliance tools to improve fleet management.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend is a React 18 single-page application built with TypeScript, featuring a component-based architecture and `shadcn/ui`. It uses Wouter for routing and TanStack Query for server state management. The design includes a comprehensive theme system (light/dark/system modes), a professional aesthetic with grouped sidebar navigation, and a command palette. Mobile-optimized components are utilized for AI insights.

## Technical Implementations

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18, TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket-based.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js, TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful
- **Validation**: Zod schemas.

### Feature Specifications
- **Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**: Calendar/list views, auto-scheduling based on PdM scores, automatic triggers, WebSocket notifications.
- **Telemetry Ingestion**: Manual CSV/JSON import, HTTP/MQTT transport, robust CSV parsing.
- **Crew Scheduling**: Optimization for fairness and preferences.
- **STCW Hours of Rest**: Maritime compliance engine with PDF report generation.
- **Condition-Based Maintenance**: Oil analysis, wear particle analysis, multi-factor condition assessment, and critical DTC override.
- **Marine Protocol Support**: J1939 CAN bus, J1708/J1587 serial protocols.
- **Cost Synchronization**: Real-time synchronization of unit costs.
- **LLM Reports System**: AI-powered reports (Health, Fleet Summary, Maintenance, Compliance) using OpenAI, with structured data output.
- **Enhanced LLM & Vessel Intelligence System**: Advanced AI/ML with anomaly detection, predictive failure risk, report context building, and multi-model support.
- **Sensor Configuration System**: CRUD operations for sensor configurations, real-time application to incoming sensor data.
- **Comprehensive Sync Expansion**: Advanced data quality monitoring with a 5-tier reconciliation system.
- **Equipment Registry Vessel Integration**: Enhanced equipment management with vessel assignment.
- **Work Order Downtime Integration**: Estimated and actual downtime tracking for work orders.
- **Vessel Financial Tracking System**: Comprehensive vessel cost analysis.

Integrates with work order auto-creation, equipment health penalties, AI/LLM reports, alert system, financial impact, dashboard metrics, telemetry correlation, and condition-based maintenance.
- **Vessel Export/Import/Deletion System**: Complete vessel data portability with JSON export/import and comprehensive deletion of associated data. Operations are secured with admin authentication, audit logging, rate limiting, and org-scoping, wrapped in database transactions.
- **Advanced Data Linking & Predictive Analytics Enhancement**: Comprehensive system for connecting predictions, maintenance, costs, crew, and inventory for continuous AI improvement. Includes prediction feedback loops, downtime tracking, part failure history, industry benchmarks, enhanced work orders (crew skills, scheduling, cost tracking), enhanced work order parts (supplier linkage, inventory), supplier quality metrics, smart scheduling, cost intelligence, inventory management, and crew skill validation.

## System Design Choices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (neon-serverless driver).
- **Schema**: Normalized, UUID primary keys, timestamp tracking.
- **Authentication**: HMAC for edge device communication.
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based layer.
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive cascade deletion system with transaction support for atomicity, admin authentication, audit logging, and rate limiting on critical operations.
