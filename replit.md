# Overview

ARUS (Marine Predictive Maintenance & Scheduling) is a full-stack web application designed to enhance operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and ensure regulatory compliance for marine fleets. It achieves this by monitoring marine equipment, processing telemetry data, and performing advanced predictive maintenance. The platform offers real-time device monitoring, equipment health analytics, intelligent maintenance scheduling, advanced inventory management, and AI-powered reporting.

## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend is a React 18 single-page application using TypeScript, `shadcn/ui`, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state management. It features a professional aesthetic, a comprehensive theme system, grouped sidebar navigation, a command palette, and mobile-optimized components. Alerts are handled via non-intrusive auto-dismissing toast notifications. The design is mobile-first responsive with bottom navigation, thumb-zone optimized touch targets, horizontally scrollable tab headers, and adaptive layouts. UI/UX improvements focus on discoverability, information density, visual hierarchy, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant) across all modules (Analytics, Equipment Registry, Inventory, Crew, Maintenance, Reports). Key enhancements include compact stat displays, consolidated filters, simplified table layouts, contextual actions, humanized timestamps, and a comprehensive tooltip system explaining technical terms. User-facing UUIDs have been eliminated in favor of human-readable names. All ML and AI platform pages (ML Training, Operating Parameters, Maintenance Templates) use horizontally scrollable tabs that prevent text/icon overlapping on mobile devices.

## Technical Implementations

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18, TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`

This includes compact stat displays, unified filtering, streamlined tables, visual cues, and consolidated export options.
- **UUID Elimination**: Replaced UUIDs with human-readable names (e.g., equipment.name, woNumber) across the application, especially in reports and work orders.
- **User-Friendliness Tooltip System**: Implemented 18 `InfoTooltip` components across key pages for explaining technical terminology in plain language, ensuring accessibility.
- **Dialog Accessibility Compliance**: All dialogs use WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant `DialogContent` and `DialogDescription` for screen reader support.
- **Centralized Organization Context**: Standardized organization ID extraction across API endpoints.
- **Production Code Quality Enhancement**: Comprehensive cleanup of debugging logs, improved error handling, centralized export utilities, navigation refactoring, and a plan for large file refactoring.

- **LLM Budget Management**: Organization-level budget tracking with configurable limits, alerts, and spending analytics.
- **Auto-validation Record Creation**: ML prediction service automatically creates `model_performance_validations` records for later comparison with actual outcomes.

## System Design Choices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (neon-serverless driver).
- **Schema**: Normalized, UUID primary keys, timestamp tracking.
- **Authentication**: HMAC for edge devices; Admin authentication via `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable.
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based layer.
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive cascade deletion with transactions, admin authentication, audit logging, and rate limiting.
- **Security**: Improved CSV export injection protection; Uses `VITE_ADMIN_TOKEN` for frontend admin access.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Cache tuning, increased background job concurrency, strategic database indexes, and materialized views.

## Configuration Requirements
- **Admin Token Setup**: The `VITE_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable must match the `ADMIN_TOKEN` secret for frontend admin features to work.
