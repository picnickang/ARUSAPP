# Overview

ARUS (Marine Predictive Maintenance & Scheduling) is a full-stack web application designed to enhance operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and ensure regulatory compliance for marine fleets. It achieves this by monitoring marine equipment, processing telemetry data, and performing advanced predictive maintenance. The platform offers real-time device monitoring, equipment health analytics, intelligent maintenance scheduling, advanced inventory management, and AI-powered reporting.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend is a React 18 single-page application using TypeScript, `shadcn/ui`, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state management. It features a professional aesthetic, a comprehensive theme system, grouped sidebar navigation, a command palette, and mobile-optimized components. The design is mobile-first responsive with bottom navigation, thumb-zone optimized touch targets, horizontally scrollable tab headers, and adaptive layouts. UI/UX improvements focus on discoverability, information density, visual hierarchy, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant). User-facing UUIDs have been eliminated in favor of human-readable names.

## Technical Implementations

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18, TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket-based.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js, TypeScript

- **Condition-Based Maintenance**: Includes oil analysis, wear particle analysis, and critical DTC override.
- **Cost Synchronization**: Real-time unit cost synchronization and comprehensive vessel cost analysis.
- **LLM Reports System**: AI-powered reports (Health, Fleet Summary, Maintenance, Compliance) using OpenAI for structured data and anomaly detection.
- **Sensor Configuration System**: CRUD operations for sensor configurations with real-time application.
- **Comprehensive Sync Expansion**: 5-tier data quality monitoring and reconciliation.
- **Equipment Registry Vessel Integration**: Enhanced equipment management with vessel assignment.
- **Work Order Downtime Integration**: Tracks estimated/actual downtime with intelligent parts suggestions.
- **Real-time Multi-Device Synchronization**: WebSocket-based broadcasting for instant data propagation.
- **Offline Sync Conflict Resolution**: 3-layer hybrid system with optimistic locking, field-level tracking, and conflict resolution.
- **DTC System**: J1939 fault code retrieval, translation, tracking, and severity-based alerting.
- **Vessel Data Management**: Export, import, and deletion capabilities for vessel data.
- **Advanced Data Linking & Predictive Analytics**: Connects predictions, maintenance, costs, crew, and inventory for continuous AI improvement.
- **Advanced ML & Acoustic Monitoring**: Machine learning system with LSTM neural networks for time-series failure forecasting, Random Forest classifiers, acoustic monitoring, automated ML training, and a hybrid prediction service with multi-tenant data isolation.
- **ML-LLM Integration**: Seamless integration between ML predictions and LLM report generation.
- **Prediction Feedback Loop**: User-driven continuous improvement system allowing operators to rate predictions, submit corrections, verify outcomes, and flag inaccuracies.
- **LLM Cost Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of AI API usage across providers with comprehensive cost analysis.
- **Automated Retraining Triggers**: Intelligent system monitoring model performance degradation, negative feedback, and data availability to automatically flag models for retraining.
- **Work Order Completion â†’ ML Feedback Loop**: Automated prediction validation system that updates ML predictions when work orders complete.
- **LLM Budget Management**: Organization-level budget tracking with configurable limits, alerts, and spending analytics.
- **Cost Savings & ROI Tracking System**: Comprehensive financial tracking system that calculates and displays actual cost savings from predictive and preventive maintenance.

## System Design Choices
- **Database**: Dual-mode deployment architecture for cloud PostgreSQL (default) and local SQLite with sync (vessel mode, requires schema migration). Uses Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema**: Normalized, UUID primary keys, timestamp tracking, PostgreSQL data types (requires conversion for SQLite compatibility).
- **Authentication**: HMAC for edge devices; Admin authentication via `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable.
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based layer supporting both PostgreSQL and SQLite backends.
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive cascade deletion with transactions, admin authentication, audit logging, and rate limiting.
- **Security**: Improved CSV export injection protection; Uses `VITE_ADMIN_TOKEN` for frontend admin access; Optional local database encryption at rest.
- **Sync Management**: Automated sync manager service handles cloud synchronization, conflict resolution, and audit logging for vessel deployments (Turso embedded replicas for automatic bi-directional sync every 60 seconds).
