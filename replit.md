# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend is a React 18 single-page application built with TypeScript, utilizing a component-based architecture and `shadcn/ui`. It employs Wouter for routing and TanStack Query for server state management. The design features a professional aesthetic, a comprehensive theme system (light/dark/system modes), grouped sidebar navigation, a command palette, and mobile-optimized components for AI insights. User feedback for data refresh actions is provided via toast notifications. **Alert System**: Dashboard uses non-intrusive auto-dismissing toast notifications for real-time alerts instead of persistent banners or floating action bars, reducing visual clutter while maintaining awareness. The critical issues floating action bar has been removed from the dashboard. Users can view all alerts on the dedicated Alerts page (/alerts).

**Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Comprehensive mobile optimization with bottom navigation (<768px), thumb-zone optimized touch targets (44px+ minimum), FAB positioning above bottom nav, horizontal scroll patterns for card grids, safe area support for notched devices, responsive Dialogâ†’Sheet conversion system, mobile-optimized form utilities, and breakpoint-driven adaptive layouts (mobile: <768px, tablet: 768-1024px, desktop: >1024px).

Aligns with IBM Maximo (6+ months), Azure IoT (2-3 months minimum), and 2024 LSTM research showing diminishing returns beyond 12-18 months. **Legacy Model Enrichment**: API automatically enriches legacy ML models with tier metadata on-the-fly; models with lookbackDays calculate tier dynamically, while models lacking hyperparameters default to 30-day Bronze tier (0.85x) with isLegacy flag for backward compatibility.
- **ML-LLM Integration**: Seamless integration between ML predictions and LLM report generation to enrich report contexts.
- **ML/PDM Data Export System**: Comprehensive data portability for migration to competing predictive maintenance platforms. JSON exports include complete org-scoped datasets (raw telemetry, ML models, failure predictions, anomalies, threshold optimizations, PDM scores) compatible with IBM Maximo, Azure IoT, SAP PM, Oracle EAM. Raw telemetry data (org-filtered via vessel join) enables competing platforms to train their own predictive models from scratch using actual sensor readings. CSV exports provide standards-compliant ML models with full tier metadata for spreadsheet analysis in Excel, Pandas, or BI tools. All models enriched with adaptive training window tier metadata; legacy models without historical data receive Bronze 30-day defaults. RFC 4180-compliant CSV escaping ensures proper parsing in mainstream tools. Multi-tenant security enforced through vessel-based org filtering.
