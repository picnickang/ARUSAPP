# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend is a React 18 single-page application built with TypeScript, featuring a component-based architecture and `shadcn/ui`. It uses Wouter for routing and TanStack Query for server state management. The design includes a comprehensive theme system (light/dark/system modes), a professional aesthetic with grouped sidebar navigation, and a command palette. Mobile-optimized components are utilized for AI insights.

**User Feedback Patterns**: All refresh buttons throughout the application provide immediate visual feedback via toast notifications. When clicked, buttons display an initial "Refreshing..." toast, followed by a success toast after data is updated. This pattern ensures users always know when data refresh actions are in progress or complete, improving perceived responsiveness and transparency.

- **Compliance Tracking**: Work hours tracking shows crew within STCW limits (32 hours over 4 days)

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Sensor Status Visibility (Completed October 2025)
Enhanced sensor status display to clearly distinguish configuration state from actual telemetry state:

**Equipment Registry Improvements**:
- Added sensor status summary bar (Total/Online/Offline counts with color coding)
- Enhanced sensor display with dual indicators: actual state (Online/Offline) + configuration state ("Config: Enabled/Disabled")
- Visual warnings for problem sensors: orange border and "No Data" badge for sensors enabled but not receiving telemetry
- Last telemetry timestamp display for online sensors

**Sensor Configuration Page Improvements**:
- Added global sensor status summary bar at top of table
- Enhanced Status column with StatusIndicator component showing online/offline state
- "Config: Enabled/Disabled" labels clarify configuration vs actual state
- Orange row highlighting for enabled but offline sensors
- "No Data" badges for quick problem identification

**API Enhancement**:
- Modified `/api/sensor-configs/status` endpoint to accept optional `equipmentId` parameter
- Returns all sensor statuses when called without parameters (Sensor Configuration page)
- Returns equipment-specific statuses when equipmentId provided (Equipment Registry)
- 5-minute telemetry threshold determines online/offline status

**User Impact**: Users can now immediately identify which sensors are actually receiving data vs just configured, preventing confusion between "enabled" configuration and actual sensor operation status.

### Work Order Management UX (Completed October 2025)
Significantly improved work order creation and management workflows:

**Form Flow Enhancements**:
- Vessel-first selection flow: vessel must be selected before equipment becomes available
- Crew member dropdown with intelligent filtering by vessel and role (engineers/technicians)
- Enhanced equipment selector showing equipment type in parentheses for better context
- Fixed crew member field name bug (corrected from `fullName` to `name` to match database schema)

**Deletion & Inventory Integration**:
- Fixed critical work order deletion bugs with comprehensive cascade cleanup
- Added missing database columns: `actual_delivery_date`, `delivery_status` to work_order_parts table
- Fixed missing table imports: `workOrderChecklists`, `workOrderWorklogs` in storage layer
- Enhanced error logging for DELETE endpoint with detailed error reporting
- Verified inventory reservation/release cycle works correctly with atomic transactions and audit trail

**User Impact**: Work order creation now has a logical, vessel-centric flow that guides users through proper equipment and crew selection. Deletion now works reliably with full cascade cleanup of all related records (parts, checklists, worklogs, costs).

## Outstanding Items

### Sync Conflicts (2 Pending)
Two safety-critical sensor configuration conflicts require manual resolution:
1. **threshold**: 95 (local) vs 85 (server)
2. **max_temp**: 120 (local) vs 110 (server)

**Resolution**: Use "Data Sync" in sidebar, select preferred values, click "Resolve Conflicts". See `RESOLVE_SYNC_CONFLICTS_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.
