## 1. Equipment Health Index Algorithm

### **Business Outcome**
Predict equipment condition to prevent failures and optimize maintenance timing. Provides a 0-100% health score indicating equipment fitness.

### **Location**: `server/storage.ts` lines 7132-7206

### **Implementation Paths**

#### **Path A: ML-Based (Primary)**
**Location**: `server/storage.ts` line 7136-7158

The system attempts to use RUL engine predictions first:
1. **RUL Engine** (`server/rul-engine.ts`) calculates predictions:
   - Uses ML predictions if available (NO confidence gate here)
   - Falls back to statistical degradation analysis
   - Always returns a confidenceScore (but doesn't filter by it)

2. **Storage Layer** (`server/storage.ts`) applies confidence gate:
   ```typescript
   const rulPrediction = await rulEngine.calculateRul(equipmentId, orgId);
   
   if (rulPrediction && rulPrediction.confidenceScore > 0.3) {
     // Use ML-based prediction
     healthIndex = rulPrediction.healthIndex;
     predictedDueDays = rulPrediction.remainingDays;
     // Map risk level to status
   } else {
     // Fall back to rule-based calculation
     throw new Error('ML prediction not available or low confidence');
   }
   ```

**Critical Finding**: Confidence threshold of **0.3** is applied at the storage layer ⚠️ (industry standard is 0.7+)

#### **Path B: Rule-Based (Fallback)**
**Formula:**
```
healthIndex = ROUND((normalPct × 100 + warningPct × 60 + criticalPct × 20) / 100)
```

**Where:**
- `normalPct` = (count of normal telemetry / total readings) × 100
- `warningPct` = (count of warning telemetry / total readings) × 100
- `criticalPct` = (count of critical telemetry / total readings) × 100

**Time Degradation Penalty:**
```
if (hoursSinceLastReading > 12):
  healthIndex -= ROUND(hoursSinceLastReading × 2)
  if (hoursSinceLastReading > 24):
    status = "warning"
    predictedDueDays = MIN(predictedDueDays, 14)
```

**Final Clamping:**
```
healthIndex = MAX(0, MIN(100, healthIndex))
```

### **Risk Status Classification (Rule-Based)**
```
if (criticalPct > 20 OR healthIndex < 50):
  status = "critical"
  predictedDueDays = MAX(1, ROUND(7 - criticalPct/10))
else if (warningPct > 30 OR healthIndex < 75):
  status = "warning"
  predictedDueDays = MAX(7, ROUND(21 - warningPct/5))
else:
  status = "healthy"
  predictedDueDays = MAX(14, ROUND(30 - warningPct/10))
```

### **Analysis**

#### **Mathematical Correctness**
✅ **Weighted average is mathematically sound**
- Normal readings contribute 100% to health
- Warning readings contribute 60% to health
- Critical readings contribute 20% to health

❓ **Questions:**
1. Are weights (100/60/20) evidence-based or arbitrary?
2. Time degradation penalty of 2 points per hour - is this calibrated?
3. Why is ML confidence threshold only 0.3? Industry standard is 0.7+

#### **Industry Standard Comparison**

**ISO 17359 (Condition Monitoring):**
- Standard uses weighted sensor scoring ✅
- Typically uses 4-5 severity levels (we use 3) ⚠️
- Requires calibration against failure data ❓

**IBM Maximo:**
- Uses 0-100 health score ✅
- Combines sensor data with failure history ✅
- Adjusts weights based on equipment type ❌ (we use fixed weights)

**Fiix CMMS:**
- Similar weighted approach ✅
- Includes operating hours as factor ❌ (we only use time since last reading)
- Uses ML with 0.7+ confidence threshold ❌ (we use 0.3)

#### **Issues Identified**
1. **⚠️ Low ML Confidence Threshold**: 0.3 is too low, should be 0.7+ per industry standards
2. **❌ Fixed Weights**: Weights should vary by equipment type (bearing vs pump vs engine)
3. **⚠️ Time Penalty**: 2 points/hour degradation not validated against actual data
4. **❌ Missing Operating Hours**: Should consider total operating hours, not just time since reading

---

## 2. Predictive Maintenance (RUL) Algorithm

### **Business Outcome**
Accurately predict days until maintenance required to optimize scheduling and reduce unplanned downtime.

### **Location**: `server/rul-engine.ts` lines 48-160

### **Implementation Hierarchy**

**IMPORTANT**: The RUL engine (`server/rul-engine.ts`) has NO confidence filtering - it uses whatever predictions exist and returns the confidence score for the caller to decide.

#### **1. ML-Based RUL (Primary - Used if Available)**
**Location**: `server/rul-engine.ts` lines 107-121

```
if (mlPredictions.length > 0):
  // Use ML prediction UNCONDITIONALLY (no confidence check here)
  prediction = mlPredictions[0]
  
  if (prediction.predictedFailureDate):
    remainingDays = (predictedFailureDate - now) / (24 hours)
  
  confidenceScore = prediction.confidence || 0.5
  predictionMethod = 'ml_lstm' | 'ml_rf' | 'hybrid'
  failureProbability = prediction.failureProbability || 0.1
```

**Note**: The confidence threshold (0.3) is applied LATER in `storage.ts`, not here.

#### **2. Statistical RUL (Fallback - Used if No ML Prediction)
Uses linear regression on degradation data:

```
degradationPerDay = trendSlope / daysPerDataPoint
timeToFailure = (100 - currentDegradationValue) / degradationPerDay
```

**Linear Regression Formula:**
```
slope = (n × Σ(xy) - Σx × Σy) / (n × Σ(x²) - (Σx)²)
intercept = (Σy - slope × Σx) / n
```

**Confidence Calculation:**
```
R² = 1 - (SS_residual / SS_total)
confidence = MIN(0.95, R² × (MIN(n, 30) / 30))
```

**Failure Probability Estimation:**
```
timeFactor = MAX(0, 1 - timeToFailure/60)
rateFactor = MIN(1, trendSlope/5)
accelFactor = MIN(0.3, |acceleration|/10)

failureProbability = timeFactor × 0.5 + rateFactor × 0.3 + accelFactor × 0.2
```

### **Health Index Calculation (RUL Engine)**
**Location**: lines 314-334

```
baseHealth = MIN(100, (remainingDays / 30) × 100)

if componentStatus exists:
  avgComponentHealth = Σ(componentHealth) / componentCount
  healthIndex = baseHealth × 0.6 + avgComponentHealth × 0.4

if degradationRate > 2:
  healthIndex × 0.9  // 10% penalty for rapid degradation

healthIndex = ROUND(MAX(0, MIN(100, healthIndex)))
```

### **Degradation Pattern Analysis**
**Location**: lines 186-262

**Per-Component Linear Regression:**
- Minimum 3 data points required
- Calculates slope, volatility (RMSE), time to failure
- Uses R² for confidence metric

**Volatility Calculation:**
```
predicted_i = slope × i + intercept
residuals = Σ((actual_i - predicted_i)²)
volatility = √(residuals / n)
```

**Acceleration (Second Derivative):**
```
acceleration = (values[n-1] - values[n-2]) - (values[1] - values[0]) / n
```

### **Analysis**

#### **Mathematical Correctness**
✅ **Linear regression is properly implemented**
✅ **R² calculation is correct**
✅ **Weighted probability formula is sound**

❓ **Questions:**
1. Why 30 days baseline for 100% health? Maritime equipment varies widely
2. Is 60/40 split (RUL/components) validated?
3. Degradation rate threshold of 2 - what units? Per day? Per week?

#### **Industry Standard Comparison**

**ISO 13381 (Prognostics):**
- Recommends Weibull analysis for RUL ✅ (we have this in RUL engine)
- Linear regression is acceptable for trending ✅
- Requires confidence intervals ❌ (we only have point estimates)

**GE Predix:**
- Uses ensemble ML models (LSTM + RF) ✅ (we have this)
- Confidence threshold 0.8+ ❌ (we use 0.3)
- Provides confidence intervals ❌ (we don't)

**Uptake:**
- Similar degradation rate analysis ✅
- Uses Bayesian updating ❌ (we use fixed weights)
- Includes failure mode classification ✅ (we have this)

#### **Issues Identified**
1. **⚠️ No Confidence Intervals**: Should provide range, not just point estimate
2. **❌ Fixed 30-day Baseline**: Should vary by equipment type and criticality
3. **⚠️ Low Sample Requirements**: 3 data points too low for reliable regression (need 10+)
4. **❌ Missing Weibull Integration**: Statistical RUL should use Weibull, not just linear

---

## 3. Risk Level Classification

### **Business Outcome**
Prioritize maintenance actions based on equipment criticality and failure probability.

### **Location**: `server/rul-engine.ts` lines 359-380

### **Risk Determination Formula**

```typescript
if (failureProbability > 0.7 OR remainingDays < 7 OR healthIndex < 30):
  return 'critical'

if (failureProbability > 0.4 OR remainingDays < 21 OR healthIndex < 60):
  return 'high'

if (failureProbability > 0.2 OR remainingDays < 35 OR healthIndex < 80):
  return 'medium'

return 'low'
```

### **Thresholds Summary**

| Risk Level | Failure Probability | Remaining Days | Health Index |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Critical   | > 70%             | < 7 days       | < 30%        |
| High       | > 40%             | < 21 days      | < 60%        |
| Medium     | > 20%             | < 35 days      | < 80%        |
| Low        | ≤ 20%             | ≥ 35 days      | ≥ 80%        |

### **Analysis**

#### **Mathematical Correctness**
✅ **OR logic is appropriate** (any condition triggers higher risk)
✅ **Thresholds are monotonic** (no overlaps)

❓ **Questions:**
1. Are thresholds appropriate for marine equipment?
2. Should critical equipment have stricter thresholds?
3. Is 7 days enough warning for critical risk?

#### **Industry Standard Comparison**

**FMEA (Failure Mode Effects Analysis):**
- Uses RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection
- Our approach: Simpler, direct thresholds ✅
- Missing: Severity weighting by equipment type ❌

**MIL-STD-1629A:**
- Defines 4 criticality levels ✅ (we have 4)
- Includes consequence severity ❌ (we don't weight by consequence)
- Requires hazard analysis ❌ (we use statistical only)

**SAE JA1011 (RCM):**
- Operational vs safety-critical classification ❌ (we treat all equal)
- Failure effect analysis ❌ (we only use probability)
- Economic impact consideration ❌ (we don't factor cost)

#### **Issues Identified**
1. **❌ No Equipment Criticality**: All equipment uses same thresholds
2. **❌ Missing Consequence Severity**: Should weight by failure impact (safety, economic, operational)
3. **⚠️ 7-day Critical Window**: May be too short for parts procurement/planning
4. **❌ No Hysteresis**: Equipment oscillating near threshold will flap between states

## 5. Telemetry Aggregation & Trend Analysis

### **Location**: `server/enhanced-trends.ts`

### **Statistical Summary**
```
mean = Σ(values) / n
variance = Σ((x - mean)²) / n
stdDev = √variance
skewness = (Σ((x - mean)³) / n) / stdDev³
kurtosis = (Σ((x - mean)⁴) / n) / stdDev⁴ - 3
```

### **Linear Regression Trend:**
```
slope = (n × Σ(xy) - Σx × Σy) / (n × Σ(x²) - (Σx)²)
intercept = (Σy - slope × Σx) / n

R² = 1 - SS_residual / SS_total
where:
  SS_residual = Σ(y - predicted)²
  SS_total = Σ(y - mean)²
```

### **Anomaly Detection Methods**

#### **1. IQR Method:**
```
Q1 = 25th percentile
Q3 = 75th percentile
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lowerBound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
upperBound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR

isAnomaly = value < lowerBound OR value > upperBound
```

#### **2. Z-Score Method:**
```
z = (value - mean) / stdDev
isAnomaly = |z| > threshold (default: 3)
```

#### **3. Hybrid Approach:**
```
Combine IQR, Z-score, and isolation methods
Anomaly if detected by 2+ methods
```

### **Moving Averages**

#### **Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
```
SMA_t = Σ(values[t-window+1 : t]) / window
```

#### **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**
```
EMA_0 = value_0
EMA_t = α × value_t + (1-α) × EMA_{t-1}
where α = smoothing factor (0-1)
```

### **Seasonality Detection**
**Location**: lines 342-395

```
For each test period (24h, 168h, 8h, 720h):
  autocorr = calculateAutocorrelation(values, lag=period)
  
  if |autocorr| > 0.3:
    hasSeasonality = true
    amplitude = calculate seasonal amplitude
    phase = calculate seasonal phase
```

**Autocorrelation Formula:**
```
autocorr(lag) = Σ((x_t - mean) × (x_{t+lag} - mean)) / Σ((x_t - mean)²)
```

### **Correlation Analysis**
**Pearson Correlation:**
```
r = Σ((x - mean_x) × (y - mean_y)) / √(Σ(x - mean_x)² × Σ(y - mean_y)²)
```

**Significance Test:**
```
t = r × √((n-2) / (1-r²))
p-value = 2 × (1 - studentT_CDF(|t|, df=n-2))
```

### **Analysis**

#### **Mathematical Correctness**
✅ **All statistical formulas are correct**
✅ **IQR anomaly detection is standard**
✅ **Pearson correlation properly implemented**

❓ **Questions:**
1. Why 3-sigma for Z-score? Marine data may need tighter (2-sigma)?
2. Hybrid anomaly method weights - how determined?
3. Seasonality threshold 0.3 - is this validated?

#### **Industry Standard Comparison**

**OSIsoft PI (Process Historian):**
- Uses compression for storage ✅ (we aggregate)
- EMA for trending ✅ (we have this)
- Anomaly detection similar ✅

**AVEVA:**
- Similar statistical methods ✅
- Real-time aggregation ✅ (we batch process)
- Event-based alerts ✅ (we have threshold alerts)

#### **Issues Identified**
1. **⚠️ Fixed Anomaly Thresholds**: Should be configurable per sensor type
2. **❌ No Adaptive Baselines**: Baselines should update over time
3. **✅ Good Coverage**: Comprehensive statistical toolkit
4. **⚠️ Performance**: Complex calculations may be slow for large datasets

---

## 6. Fleet Performance Metrics

### **Location**: `server/vessel-intelligence.ts` & `server/enhanced-trends.ts`

### **Availability Calculation**
```
availability = completedWorkOrders / totalWorkOrders × (1 - criticalIncidents/100)
```

### **Reliability Calculation**
```
reliability = nonCriticalWorkOrders / totalWorkOrders
```

### **Maintainability Calculation**
```
maintainability = 100 - (avgResolutionTime / maxExpectedTime × 100)
```

### **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**
```
MTBF = totalOperatingHours / numberOfFailures
```

### **MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)**
```
MTTR = totalRepairTime / numberOfRepairs
```

### **OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)**
```
OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality
```

### **Analysis**

#### **Mathematical Correctness**
⚠️ **Availability formula is non-standard**
- Standard: `Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)`
- ARUS: `completedWorkOrders / totalWorkOrders`
- These measure different things!

⚠️ **Reliability formula is incomplete**
- Standard: `Reliability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)`
- ARUS: Uses work order ratio (proxy)

✅ **MTBF/MTTR formulas are correct**

#### **Industry Standard Comparison**

**DNV (Det Norske Veritas):**
- Availability = Operating hours / Total hours ❌ (we use work orders)
- Uses actual uptime/downtime ❌ (we approximate)

**ABS (American Bureau of Shipping):**
- MTBF calculation standard ✅
- Requires failure event logging ✅ (we have this)
- Criticality weighting ❌ (we don't weight)

**World-Class OEE:**
- Target: 85%+ for manufacturing
- Maritime: 75-80% typical
- We don't fully calculate OEE ❌

#### **Issues Identified**
1. **❌ Availability Definition Wrong**: Should use actual operating hours
2. **❌ Reliability is Proxy**: Should use proper MTBF/MTTR calculation
3. **❌ Missing OEE**: Not fully implemented
4. **❌ No Operating Hours Tracking**: Critical for accurate metrics

## 7. Cost Analytics & Optimization

### **Location**: `server/inventory.ts`

### **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**
```
EOQ = √((2 × annualDemand × orderingCost) / holdingCost)
```

### **Reorder Point**
```
leadTimeDemand = dailyDemand × leadTimeDays
safetyStock = zScore × √leadTimeDays × dailyDemand × demandVariability

reorderPoint = leadTimeDemand + safetyStock
```

**Z-scores for service levels:**
- 95% service: z = 1.645
- 99% service: z = 2.326
- 90% service: z = 1.282

### **Inventory Optimization**
```
currentHoldingCost = currentStock × unitCost × holdingCostRate
optimalHoldingCost = optimalStock × unitCost × holdingCostRate
potentialSavings = |currentHoldingCost - optimalHoldingCost|
```

### **Maintenance Cost Planning**
```
taskLaborCost = laborHours × averageLaborRate
taskMaterialCost = Σ(partQuantity × unitCost)
taskTotalCost = taskLaborCost + taskMaterialCost
```

### **ROI Calculation** (Implied)
```
ROI = (preventedFailureCost - maintenanceCost) / maintenanceCost × 100%
```

### **Analysis**

#### **Mathematical Correctness**
✅ **EOQ formula is correct** (Wilson formula)
✅ **Reorder point calculation is standard**
✅ **Safety stock uses proper z-score**

❓ **Questions:**
1. How is holding cost rate determined? (typically 20-30% of unit cost)
2. Ordering cost - fixed or variable?
3. Demand variability calculation - is it validated?

#### **Industry Standard Comparison**

**SAP PM/S4HANA:**
- Similar EOQ calculation ✅
- Uses ABC analysis ❌ (we don't classify)
- Dynamic reorder points ✅
- Total Cost of Ownership ❌ (we don't calculate)

**eMaint:**
- Labor + material costing ✅
- Preventive vs corrective cost ratio ❌
- Work order cost tracking ✅

**Maximo:**
- Comprehensive cost analysis ✅
- Budget forecasting ❌ (we don't forecast)
- Cost per operating hour ❌ (missing)

#### **Issues Identified**
1. **❌ Missing ABC Classification**: Should prioritize high-value parts
2. **❌ No Cost Forecasting**: Should predict future costs
3. **✅ Good EOQ Implementation**: Standard and correct
4. **❌ Missing TCO**: Total cost of ownership not calculated

---

## 8. Statistical Analysis Methods

### **Core Functions** (`server/utils/statistics.ts`)

#### **Mean & Standard Deviation**
```
mean = Σ(values) / n
variance = Σ((x - mean)²) / n  
stdDev = √variance
```

#### **Quantiles**
```
quantile(p) = sorted_values[⌊p × n⌋]
```

#### **Skewness**
```
skewness = (Σ((x - mean)³) / n) / stdDev³
```

#### **Kurtosis**
```
kurtosis = (Σ((x - mean)⁴) / n) / stdDev⁴ - 3
```

#### **Autocorrelation**
```
autocorr(lag) = Σ((x_t - mean) × (x_{t+lag} - mean)) / Σ((x_t - mean)²)
```
